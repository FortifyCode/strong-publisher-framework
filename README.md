# Strong Publisher Engine Framework

## Introduction
Strong Publisher engine is intended to be a PHP site engine to be fast and
efficient in providing almost static sites efficiency.
It is build to serve mostly on static files and pre processed or cached files,
nothing from dinamic sources.
The administration can be done externally with an independent admin system that
publish all the files and pre process all that is required for the site to
function.
